As an ever evolving Frontend Developer I realized that the new content (that I am willing to share with you) didn’t really fit into [the old website](https://gillyhuga.github.io/) layout. So the best solution to this: a new website design, a new logo, new categorization etc… So it’s well structured now :)

This is my first website using React.js. I developed this website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). So, this website will continue to grow as a place for me to tell stories and share projects that I have worked on. 

Thank you for visiting my website. Have a nice day :)
